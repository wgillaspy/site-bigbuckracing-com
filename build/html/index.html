     </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-8 offset-lg-2">
     <h3>First let's get you straight - WE DO NOT RACE IN SAND HERE!</h3>
     <p>Our soil varies from brown loam to red clay to some pretty sticky mud places. We are in the Piedmont Region and have rolling hills, no mountains as such, however if you walk several of our hills you might slide the classification from hill to small mountain! We have field sections for super high speeds and engine cooling, the pastures are terraced and this gives you plenty of opportunity for minor air time. The course will go through young planted pine sections where you cannot see ten feet ahead, older pine forests with the chance to go fast, hardwood forests with slick leaves to contend with and mixed stands of pine and hardwoods where its single file racing. Down by the Tyger River we have all the mud one could desire! We try to include our trademark creek jump when weather conditions allow!!  Throughout the course you will find smaller creeks, gullies, rocks, stumps (stump holes), briers, and the very devil himself--grape vines! Grape vines just off the course will take you off your ride instantly making you wish you had stayed on the marked section. Course length varies from four to twelve miles, once again depending on weather conditions and which classes will be using it. You will not be disappointed! The creek jump is not available to all classes.</p>

       <h4>Blackstock Battleground</h4>
       <p><img class="img-fluid rounded  float-start me-3" src="assets/img/interest/blackstock.jpg">Includes a historical marker. Revolutionary War battle of Nov. 20,1780 which was fought adjoining the property you will be racing on! Lt. Col Thomas Sumter (The Gamecock) led the Patriot forces, under his command were Lt. Col. James McCall, Lt. Col. Henry Hamton, Lt. Col. Edward Lacey, and Lt. Col. William Hill; these commanding militia units from South Carolina and Georgia. The British forces were under the command of Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton, who was notorious from The Waxhaws Fight on May 29, 1780 where patriot militiamen surrendered and were cut down with the sabre (Tarleton's quarter). Sumter's forces were preparing to ford the Tyger River when Ms Mary Dillard rode to tell him that Tarleton's column had earlier passed her house and contained calvary and infantry but no artillery.
        Sumter realized Tarleton would overtake his force before they could complete the fording and decided to take defensive positions at Blackstock's Plantation. Tarleton's command included his own Legion of Dragoons and a mounted infantry battalion of the 71st. Highlanders. Tarleton's troop, being mounted, had gone on ahead of the main British army, and thus had no artillery support. Tarleton had never been defeated in battle but that day he was stopped- not defeated- and his force withdrew to a nearby high hill. Sumter was badly wounded in the shoulder, chest, and back. Sumter's forces forded the Tyger River that night and thus left Tarleton in possession of the field. Sumter was not expected to live and his men carried him across the river wrapped in a cow hide. He did recover and fought other battles. This was the first time Tarleton had been stopped in a battle.</p>

      <p><img style="background-color: #ebe1c0;" class="img-fluid rounded  float-start me-3" src="assets/img/logo-h.png"> In 1973 I purchased the property and the family (Dad Henry Jr., myself, and son Hank) spent many memorable fall days together deer hunting. First one to come out of the woods usually built a campfire up and as the others gathered around later we always asked if anyone had seen the “Big Buck”.</p>   

      <p>One day in 1981 I came home from work and Hank told me he wanted a racing go-kart. He was 10 years old then and before I knew it we were at Speedway Park for his first Saturday night kart race! Years 1982-1990 saw us all over the eastern U.S. with the WKA Horstman Gold Cup Series. During that time I witnessed the almost explosive growth of kart racing.</p>  

      <p>Fast forward to 1996 when Hank asked me to go with him while he raced in a Mid East Hare Scramble. I didn’t even know what a hare scramble was but when there I saw the opportunity to be a part of that type racing before it “outgrew” my being involved. So I left Mid East Hare Scramble Series Promoter Buren Hamrick a note on a scrap of paper offering to host a national event if the opportunity ever presented itself.</p>

      <p>Later that year Buren called me in his role as GNCC Trail Designer for GNCC Boss Dave Coombs; a preview of the property led to his only question: “What do you want to name it”? Hank decided the time had come to share the “Big Buck” with GNCC riders from all over the world! (Note: No, we never shot the “Big Buck”, and I’ll bet no rider ever claims to have tamed the Big Buck GNCC.)</p>

      <p>1997 saw the first Big Buck Grand National Cross Country held in Union County, SC and the 2015 VP Racing Fuels Big Buck GNCC is the nineteenth. In that time over 19,000 riders from all over the world have participated in the Big Buck GNCC events.</p>

      <p>Kawasaki chose the Big Buck as the site to introduce their long awaited ATV (then called the V FORCE) to the public. Riders, writers, and Kawasaki officials left Union County, SC satisfied they had challenged some of the best trails in the world- the GNCC trails of the Big Buck.</p>

      <p>Yamaha came to the Big Buck in 2009 to introduce their latest ATV, the YFZ450X, to the world. Again the riders, writers and Yamaha officials were impressed with the GNCC trails and terrain.</p>

      <p>We invite you to join us at the VP Racing Fuels Big Buck GNCC!</p>
