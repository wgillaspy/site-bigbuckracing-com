    <h2>Blackstock Battleground</h2>
    <div id="item-description">
        <p>Includes a historical marker. Revolutionary War
            battle of Nov. 20,1780 which was fought adjoining the property you will be
            racing on! Lt. Col Thomas Sumter (The Gamecock) led the Patriot forces,
            under his command were Lt. Col. James McCall, Lt. Col. Henry Hamton, Lt.
            Col. Edward Lacey, and Lt. Col. William Hill; these commanding militia
            units from South Carolina and Georgia. The British forces were under the
            command of Lt. Col. Banastre Tarleton, who was notorious from The
            Waxhaws
            Fight on May 29, 1780 where patriot militiamen surrendered and were cut
            down with the sabre (Tarleton's quarter). Sumter's forces were preparing
            to ford the Tyger River when Ms Mary Dillard rode to tell him that
            Tarleton's column had earlier passed her house and contained calvary and
            infantry but no artillery.<br>
            Sumter realized Tarleton would overtake his force before they could
            complete the fording and decided to take defensive positions at
            Blackstock's Plantation. Tarleton's command included his own Legion of
            Dragoons and a mounted infantry battalion of the 71st. Highlanders.
            Tarleton's troop, being mounted, had gone on ahead of the main British
            army, and thus had no artillery support. Tarleton had never been
            defeated in battle but that day he was stopped- not defeated- and his force
            withdrew to a nearby high hill. Sumter was badly wounded in the
            shoulder,
            chest, and back. Sumter's forces forded the Tyger River that night and
            thus left Tarleton in possession of the field. Sumter was not expected to
            live and his men carried him across the river wrapped in a cow hide. He
            did recover and fought other battles. This was the first time Tarleton had
            been stopped in a battle.<br></p>
